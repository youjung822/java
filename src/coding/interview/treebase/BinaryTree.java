    * A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree.
    * Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically
    * name them the left and right child.
    * [Why Binary Tree?]
    * 1. to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy
    * 2. Trees provide moderate access/search (quicker than
    *    Linked List and slower than arrays).
    * 3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than
    *    Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists).
    * 4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an
    *    upper limit on number of nodes as nodes are linked using pointers.
